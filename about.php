     <p class="about-page-paragraph">We’re a young skincare brand that sells like hot cake while telling you to buy only what your skin needs. We are here on our mission to challenge the burgeoning beautyverse that is getting filled with a new skincare product every hour. We help young moms and moms-to-be to re-think the way they look at skincare.</p>
     <p class="about-page-paragraph">Just like other entrepreneurs, we dream big. Our goal is to help young mothers become attune to the needs of their skin and not what they are being told by others or much-hyped beauty gurus.</p>
     <p class="about-page-paragraph">We know skincare products are thick on the ground. And this can bum you out. So, we’re here to tell every young mom and would-be-mom to #Simplifyiskincare in lieu of stocking up their beauty counters with several complicated products. So, when others tell you to slather on and on, shout out loud and say “My skin is smart”.</p>
     <h3 class="about-page-paragraph-heading">Because We Want The Best For Every Baby & Mama</h3>

And because you deserve the best too, we at BabyMelon promise to bring your way all the goodness of nature. To make your pregnancy journey magical as you make your way to your little bundle of joy.

     <h3 class="about-page-paragraph-heading">A Little More We Want You To Know</h3>
     <ul style="margin-bottom: 70px;">
         <li class="about-page-lists">We believe in QUALITY & not QUANTITY so, 50 products at once is not our thing!</li>
         <li class="about-page-lists">We don’t have “overnight fixes” or “instant results”.</li>
         <li class="about-page-lists">We don’t pretend we have the right products for all.</li>
         <li class="about-page-lists">We aren’t selling products in the name of profit.</li>
         <li class="about-page-lists">We don’t believe in achieving a ‘perfect’ skin and don’t tell you to believe in the same.</li>
     </ul>

     <p class="about-page-paragraph">BabyMelon is for moms and moms-to-be who prefer skin over skincare. And so do we, you have our back! Approach us anytime, through email or social media, and we will be there to help you in every way we can.</p>
